I’ve developed iOS apps for fun and professionally for more than a decade and have been building and designing video games since I could hold a pencil. Here are some things I’ve made for fun:</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="unreleased-tactics-game"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/axjl6Tg.mp4">Unreleased Tactics Game</a></h2>
<p>A turn based tactics game that mixes strategic planning and frantic pivoting when the plan falls apart. My current hobby project and the biggest game I’ve worked on. Written in C# using Unity.</p>

<p>A playable prototype is available here using placeholder art and scenarios. This was largely a proof of concept, but does provide a vertical slice of the gameplay.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="spent"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/pNUd1se.mp4">Spent</a></h2>
<p>An iOS app that tracks monthly budgets visually, synchronized between two users using a Firebase datastore. Written in UI Kit and a dash of Swift UI. This is unpublished and simply a tool I wrote for a few people I know.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="space-bits"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0PIoDkulos">Space Bits</a></h2>
<p>An iOS game and the first commercial game I shipped. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131124124059/https://techraptor.net/2013/09/03/space-bits-review-ios/">Some people thought it was alright!</a> This is an old one predating SpriteKit. Written in Objective-C using Cocos2D, and sadly no longer available for download.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="decorator-pattern-tutorial"><a href="https://github.com/odicay/RandomlyDecoratedItems">Decorator Pattern Tutorial</a></h2>
<p>An overview on using the decorator pattern to architect randomly generated game loot. Another really old one in Objective-C. Worth a mention for how fun it was to put together.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="game-prototypes"><a href="https://youtu.be/h7YrKNgm-EE">Game Prototypes</a></h2>
<p>I’ve worked on a bunch of prototypes and proof of concepts that never made it to release, but were invaluable learning experiences. These are a good mix of Unity/C# and Swift/SpriteKit.</p>
